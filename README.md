# SYNC-INTERNS
A weather application that provides detailed 
weather details for a location specified by the 
user. 
Built using React and Open Weather API for 
showing the latest weather data. Here we have search 
options with city and country for which we would 
like to see a weather forecast. 
We will use the fetch method to fetch the API calls 
along with the React hooks and conditional 
rendering.
